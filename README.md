# üß¨ Enzyme Classification Project

## üìå Overview

This project focuses on **classifying proteins into enzymes vs. non-enzymes** using only their amino acid sequences.

We start from **raw FASTA files**, clean and preprocess the data, extract biologically meaningful features, and train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost). The goal is to evaluate baseline classifiers and establish a foundation for more advanced sequence-based function prediction.

## üî¨ Workflow

The project is structured into several key steps:

1. **Dataset Preparation**

   * Parse enzyme and non-enzyme FASTA files using Biopython.
   * Build a combined dataset with labels (`1 = enzyme`, `0 = non-enzyme`).

2. **Data Cleaning**

   * Remove duplicate sequences.
   * Remove overlapping sequences present in both classes.
   * Drop sequences with invalid amino acids or length > 2500 residues.

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Sequence length.
   * Amino acid composition (fraction of each residue).
   * Create feature matrix (`X`) and labels (`y`).

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Histograms of sequence lengths.
   * Distributions of amino acid fractions.

5. **Preprocessing**

   * Scale sequence length feature with `StandardScaler`.
   * Preserve amino acid composition fractions.

6. **Modeling & Evaluation**

   * Train/test split (80/20 stratified).
   * Train baseline models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
   * Evaluate with **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC**.
   * Plot confusion matrices and ROC curves.
   * Run cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).

## üìä Results (Baseline)

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1     | ROC-AUC |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Logistic Regression | \~0.85   | \~0.83    | \~0.86 | \~0.84 | \~0.90  |
| Random Forest       | \~0.90   | \~0.89    | \~0.91 | \~0.90 | \~0.95  |
| XGBoost             | \~0.91   | \~0.90    | \~0.92 | \~0.91 | \~0.96  |

*(Values are approximate, results depend on dataset splits & tuning.)*

## üìå Future Work

* Use **transformer-based embeddings** (e.g., ProtBERT, ESM) instead of handcrafted features.
* Explore **homology reduction** to avoid sequence redundancy.
* Expand dataset with more diverse enzymes.
* Apply deep learning methods (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers).
